# TheraMDCoin White Paper (Draft)

## Our Mission

**TheraMDCoin (Symbol: TMDC)** is a revolutionary platform that democratizes access to molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory data, providing a decentralized ecosystem to support research and innovation across computational chemistry and drug discovery. By offering high-quality, verified MD data, TheraMDCoin empowers researchers and industry professionals to unlock deeper insights into complex molecular interactions and streamline the development of cutting-edge therapeutics. Among the many applications of TheraMDCoin, its transformative potential is particularly evident in advancing PROTAC-based therapeutics.

PROTACs (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras) are pioneering tools for targeted protein degradation, enabling the therapeutic modulation of previously "undruggable" proteins. Designing effective PROTACs requires a nuanced understanding of the dynamic interactions between the target protein, E3 ligase, and the linker that connects them. TheraMDCoin’s MD trajectory data provides unprecedented insights into the formation, stability, and conformational dynamics of these ternary complexes, facilitating not only a deeper understanding of these processes but also direct prediction and virtual screening of PROTAC designs to optimize efficacy and selectivity.

Leveraging TheraMDCoin’s decentralized data resources, researchers can explore how variations in linker length, flexibility, and composition impact PROTAC performance. This information can be integrated with machine learning models to predict degradation potential for novel PROTACs, accelerating the discovery process. Moreover, TheraMDCoin’s platform aids in evaluating off-target interactions and assessing the impact of mutations, paving the way for the design of resistance-proof therapies.

Beyond these core applications, TheraMDCoin’s extensive MD data repository also supports the optimization of pharmacokinetic properties, such as solubility, membrane permeability, and overall drug-like characteristics. By enabling comprehensive computational analyses, TheraMDCoin streamlines the rational design and optimization of PROTAC-based therapies, ultimately advancing more effective and selective treatments.

TheraMDCoin’s innovative approach to MD trajectory data is transforming the landscape of therapeutic development. While its utility extends across a wide array of fields, its role in advancing PROTAC therapeutics exemplifies how blockchain technology and decentralized data sharing can revolutionize research, offering a powerful tool for addressing complex scientific challenges and fostering groundbreaking medical advancements.

## What is TheraMDCoin?

TheraMDCoin is a cryptotoken designed to incentivize contributions to molecular dynamics simulations. Through blockchain-based technology, TheraMDCoin creates a decentralized marketplace where professional users can share their computed MD trajectory data, and non-professional users can contribute GPU computing power to execute assigned simulation tasks. The token ecosystem rewards participants fairly while ensuring data authenticity and accessibility.

## How are We Different?

Unlike traditional data-sharing systems, TheraMDCoin integrates blockchain technology and cryptographic mechanisms to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency. Key distinctions include:

1. **Incentive Structure**

   - Professional users earn tokens by submitting new or verified MD trajectory data.
   - Non-professional users are rewarded for contributing GPU power to complete computational tasks.
   - New, verified data submissions yield higher rewards compared to pre-existing database structures.

2. **Data Verification and Quality Assurance**

   - Advanced algorithms and community governance ensure the validity and uniqueness of submitted data.
   - A decentralized verification system evaluates contributions for authenticity.

3. **Blockchain Network and Security Contributions**

   - TheraMDCoin operates on the Ethereum Mainnet, leveraging its proven security and decentralized infrastructure. Participants can also contribute to blockchain security through staking, receiving additional rewards for helping maintain the integrity of the network.

4. **Task Distribution Platform**

   - Users select MD simulation tasks from a dedicated platform, tailored to their computational capabilities.

   - Initial tasks focus on PROTAC-related MD simulations, supporting the development of protein degradation therapeutics. Over time, additional task categories will be introduced to address broader research needs.

5. **Workload Optimization**

   - TheraMDCoin utilizes a PoW model to reward users contributing GPU and CPU resources. Only users with GPU resources and Amber pre-installed are eligible for the PoW mechanism.

6. **Research Collaboration**

   - Verified MD simulation data is stored in a decentralized database, enabling global researchers and developers to access high-quality datasets and advance scientific discoveries.

### Core Components

1. **MD Task Platform**

   - A hub for distributing simulation tasks and collecting resulting data.

2. **Participants**

   - **Professional Users:** Submit computed trajectory data.
   - **Non-Professional Users:** Contribute GPU computing power for assigned tasks.

3. **Database**

   - A decentralized repository for verified trajectory data, accessible to researchers and developers worldwide.

4. **Tokens (TheraMDCoin, or TMDC)**

   - The medium of exchange and incentive within the ecosystem, rewarding data and computing contributions.

### Workflow

1. Professional users submit MD trajectory data to the platform.
2. Submitted data undergoes verification via automated and community-led processes.
3. Verified data is added to the shared database.
4. Non-professional users complete assigned tasks using contributed GPU power.
5. Tokens are distributed to participants based on their contributions.
6. Users stake TheraMDCoin to access MD data insights.
7. Users redeem TheraMDCoin by uploading new MD trajectories, maintaining ecosystem balance.

## Token Economy

### Utility of TheraMDCoin

1. **Incentivizing Contributions:**
   - Users upload MD trajectories to receive TheraMDCoin rewards.
2. **Accessing Data:**
   - Users stake TheraMDCoin to access high-quality MD data (whose price is determined by the system size, simulation duration, frame rate, etc.) or computational resources (whose price is determined by the amount of floating point computing power of the CPU/GPU).
3. **Token Redemption Loop:**
   - Users upload new MD trajectories to redeem staked tokens, creating a closed-loop system that incentivizes continued data contribution and platform engagement.

## Governance and Community

1. **Community Validators:**

   - Decentralized validation of data and task outputs.

2. **Collaborations:**

   - Partnerships with academic and industrial institutions to expand the ecosystem.

3. **Decentralized Governance:**

   - Token holders participate in ecosystem decision-making, ensuring alignment with user needs.

## Future Roadmap

### Technical Development

- Integration of advanced verification algorithms.
- Support for additional molecular simulation tools and formats.

### Community Growth

- Expanding partnerships with academic and industry stakeholders.
- Incentivizing non-professional user participation.

### Ecosystem Expansion

- Enabling token utilization beyond the core platform.
- Establishing TheraMDCoin as a standard for molecular simulation data sharing.
